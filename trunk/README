Smart Menu for Android


Description
----------------------------------------------
SmartMenu? provide a simple, easy to use menu which can be added
over any Android view. The user must perform a gesture to display it.


Usage
----------------------------------------------
SmartMenuOverlayView is a class extended from GestureOverlayView.
You need to add a gesture library in order to use it, for example
the res/raw/gesture file, which contains a gesture for a little
circle.

You can use this class as you would do for a GestureOverlayView, by
adding any View or Layout into it. There's a good documentation
about this at :
http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/gestures.html

You must add items to your menu (up to 8) using the
SmartMenuOverlayView.SmartMenuItems class, each with a label and a
picture. The picture *must* be at least 48x48. Override the
onItemSelected method for each menu item to do what you want.

The size of the displayed menu is computed from the size of the
view, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
